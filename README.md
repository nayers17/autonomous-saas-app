Project Overview
Nathan Ayers' Autonomous SaaS Web Application is designed to develop software solutions tailored to current industry demands. Leveraging automated data collection, machine learning, fine-tuning, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the platform automates the entire pipeline from problem identification to software deployment.

Key Components:
Data Collection and Problem Identification:
Web scraping and API integrations to gather industry trends and business challenges.
NLP models (e.g., DistilBERT) to classify and extract business problems from collected data.
Code Generation:
Utilizes CodeT5-small and GPT-2-small models on a 3060 GPU to generate code based on identified problems.
Implements RAG with FAISS for fetching relevant code snippets to enhance generation quality.
Autonomous Deployment:
CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and AWS Elastic Beanstalk for automatic deployment.
Docker containerization ensures consistent and scalable deployments.
Testing and Feedback:
Automated tests with pytest to ensure functionality.
Feedback loops collect performance data, enabling autonomous model improvements based on user interactions.
Features
Automated Data Collection: Gathers real-time industry data to identify pressing business needs.
Intelligent Problem Identification: Uses advanced NLP techniques to categorize and understand business challenges.
Dynamic Code Generation: Generates tailored software solutions using state-of-the-art machine learning models.
Seamless Deployment: Automatically deploys generated solutions to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
Continuous Improvement: Incorporates user feedback to refine models and enhance solution quality.
Technologies Used
Backend: Python, FastAPI
Frontend: [Specify if applicable, e.g., React, Vue.js]
Machine Learning: Transformers (DistilBERT, CodeT5-small, GPT-2-small), FAISS
Data Collection: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Requests
Database: PostgreSQL/MySQL
Deployment: Docker, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, GitHub Actions
Testing: pytest, Selenium/Cypress (for end-to-end tests)
